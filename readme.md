# ChatBot

### Instructions

- Clone the repo
- Create virtual environment 
- `pip install requirements.txt`
- Then first run this command `python chatbot/download_model.py`
   ( This will download two files which is our w2vecmodel.model & w2vecmodel.mod.vectors.npy )
- Then run `python main.py`

###### If you feel the response from the chatbot is not good just add query and response in chatbot/Faqs_pdeu.csv.

This is all :)
